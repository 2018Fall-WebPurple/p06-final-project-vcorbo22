        <p class="indent"><b>Katherine Goble Johnson</b> is a mathenican and computer scientist. She worked for the <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/NASA" target="_blank">National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA)</a> for more than three decades. She helped calculate and analye the flight paths of many spaecrafts.</p>
        
            <br/>
        
        <p class="indent">Katherine is very intellagent. At the age of ten, she started to attend high school. Later, she gaduated college at the age of eightteen. She attended <i>West Virgina State College</i> (today known as West Virgina State University).</p>
        
            <br/>
        
        <p class="indent">Katherine began working at the <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/National-Advisory-Committee-for-Aeronautics-United-States" target="_blank">National Advisory Committe for Aeronautics (NACA)</a>. She was in the West Area Computing unit. This unit consited of a group of African American women who manually performed complex mathematical calulations for the program's engineers. Everyday these women analyzed test data and provided mathematical computations that were essenital to the success of the early United States space program. At this time, NACA was segregated.</p>
        
            <br/>
        <p class="indent">Katherine was a member of the Space Task Group. In 1960, she coauthored a paper with one of the group's engineers about calculations for placing a spacecraft into orbit. This was the first time a woman in her division recevived credit as an author of a reearch report. She did twenty-five other reports after her first.</p>
        
            <br/>
        
        <p class="indent">Katherine helped NASA a lot. She played an important role in NASA's Mercury program of manned spaceflights. She calculated the path for <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/Freedom-7" target="_blank">Freedom 7</a>. Freedom 7 was the spacecraft that put the first United States astronaut in space. Katherine verified that the elctronic computer planned John Glenn's flight correctly. She was also part of the team that calculated where and when to lunch the rokcet for the <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/Apollo-11" target="_blank">Apolo 11</a> mission of 1969. In 1986, Katherine retired from NASA.</p>
